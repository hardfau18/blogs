### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am hardfault

About me, I like to play CTF's(reversing and binary exploitation), ricing my linux set up, turn based strategy games(chess, wesnoth).
I like Rust and I use rust for most of my personal work, and Python and ~~bash~~ [nu](https://www.nushell.sh/) for scripting and automating. BTW I use arch.

#### ðŸ¤“ Currently I know
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- C
- Python
- Lua
- ~~Bash~~ Nushell for scripting
